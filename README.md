Harlem Grown's mission is to inspire youth to live healthy and ambitious lives through mentorship and hands-on education in urban farming, sustainability, and nutrition.
I am teaching an HTML / CSS class twice a week for the duration of the camp that is themed around food sustainability and environmental justice.
