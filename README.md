* Introduction to HTML
  1. So, what does HTML stand for? HyperText Markup Language! You're probably thinking, "I still have no idea what this HTML thing is." I don't blame you! Basically, HTML allows us to create content for websites. This can include things like inserting images, tables, headings, paragraphs of text, and more.
  2. I hate to break to you, but using HTML alone ain't pretty. If you've seen any websites yourself, you have probably noticed colors, font-sizes, and other wonderful styling. This does NOT come from an HTML document. Think of HTML as the skeleton of your website and there's something else to transform that. In other words, we need something to make that skeleton into a living, breathing human instead of an ugly structure of bones. Sorry for the creepy image I may have just given your mind!
  3. Okay, so what is that something? How does the skeleton become a person? How do we make the plain website look good? With CSS! Ah, another set of letters with no obvious meaning. Yeah, CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. Yup. Basically, CSS gives the skeleton webpage life with colors, fonts, and other styling.
  4. Now, you have an idea of how websites come together. There's an HTML document for structure and there's a CSS document for styling.
  5. Yeah! Go us! Can someone explain all of this stuff? Put it in your own words. One volunteer and then we'll start our first HTML document!
